#AIM: Write a parallel program in c, c++, java, or python to compute the dot product and cross product for
N elements vector arrays a[N] and b[N].
A sample c program is given below:
#include "threads.h" /* Routines for thread creation/synchronization. */
#include < stdio.h> /* Routines for input/output. */
#define N 100 /* Number of elements in each vector. */
#define P 4 /* Number of processors for parallel execution. *
double a[N], b[N]; /* Vectors for computing the dot product. */
double partial_sums[P]; /* Array of results computed by threads. */
Barrier bar; /* Shared variable to support barrier synchronization. */
void ParallelFunction (void) {
int my_id, i, start, end;
double s;
my_id = get_my_thread_id (); /* Get unique identifier for this thread. */
start = (N/P) * my_id; /* Determine start/end using thread identifier. */
end = (N/P) * (my_id + 1) – 1; /* N is assumed to be evenly divisible by P .*/
s = 0.0;
for (i = start; i <= end; i++)
s = s + a[i] * b[i];
partial_sums[my_id] = s; /* Save result in array. */
barrier (&bar, P); /* Synchronize with other threads. */
}
void main (void)
{
int i;
double dot_product;
< Initialize vectors a[], b[] – details omitted.>
init_barrier (&bar);
for (i = 1; i <= P; i++) /* Create P – 1 additional threads. */
{
create_thread (ParallelFunction);
}
ParallelFunction(); /* Main thread also joins parallel execution. */
dot_product = 0.0; /* After barrier synchronization, compute final result. */
for (i = 0; i < P; i++){
dot_product = dot_product + partial_sums[i];
}
printf ("The dot product is %g\ n", dot_product);
}
